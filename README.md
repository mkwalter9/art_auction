## Art Auction estimator

This project is attempting to predict the sale prices of artwork.  
Data is collected from ArtBNK by artist.  

I'm using different references as I go - starting originally from the [Harvard DS Review](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/1vdc2z91/release/1)

As of 1/16/21 I'm pretty much following along with the [Aubry paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3347175), albeit with my own much more limited data and slightly different features.
